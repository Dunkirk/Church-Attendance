Basic Instructions:

* Create a PostgreSQL database to hold the data using the `createdb' command.
* In "attendance.sql", change the name "dbuser" to the database user that owns the newly created database.
* Use "attendance.sql" to load the schema from backup.
* Manually insert one administrative user into the "users" table.
* Edit "connect.php" and change the variables to the appropriate values.
* Edit "header.html" to taste.
* Setup the web server to point to the directory that contains the application.

There's software in here for producing a PDF report of the directory. This has it's own copyright information.
